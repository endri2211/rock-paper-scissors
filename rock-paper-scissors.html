The Odin Project instructions

# create a function called computerPlay that randomly returns "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
	# the function picks a random value from an array which contains rock paper scissors
	# create variable for computerSelection, which is going to be taken from the function computerPlay

# create variable for playerSelection, which is going to be an input


# create a function called playRound that plays a single round of the game, and takes two parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection
	# this function should return a string that declares the winner: "You lose! Paper beats Rock"
	# this function compares the variables playerSelection and computerSelection for all three cases, player victory, tie or loss

# display the return of the playRound function using the console.log()

# create a new function called game() which plays a 5 round game
# this function keeps the score
# and returns the winner at the end
